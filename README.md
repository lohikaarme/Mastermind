# Mastermind
Project: Mastermind from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-mastermind). Developed a two player (Human, AI) environment where you have the choice between making or guessing the code.

## Learnings
Attempted to implement [Knuth's algorithm](https://www.cs.uni.edu/~wallingf/teaching/cs3530/resources/knuth-mastermind.pdf) for the most efficient AI solver by guessing the code that would eliminate the highest number of possible combinations until only the correct answer remained.
